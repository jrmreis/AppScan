# Integration AppScan Standard (DAST) and Gitlab
<br>
It will help to Integrate AppScan Standard on Gitlab. It will enable Gitlab to start scan, generate pdf/xml report, publish results to AppScan Enterprise and check for Security Gate.<br>
<br>
Requirements:<br>
1 - AppScan Standard in Windows Server (it was tested on Windows 2019).<br>
2 - Add AppScan Standard folder to Windows PATH Environment Variable.<br>
3 - Install Gitlab Runner for Windows in same Windows Server that has AppScan STD.<br>
  3.1 - Add Gitlab Runner as a Service.<br>
  3.2 - Change User Service to same User that has access in AppScan Enterprise. AppScanSTD will use this user name and password to publish into Appscan Enterprise.<br>
4 - Enable Long Paths in Windows. It is not mandatory but I guess it will safe some troubleshoot time.<br>
